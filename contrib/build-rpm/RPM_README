Fedora and CentOS RPM Build Guide for DBMail
This has been tested on a Fedora LXD Container but on a VM or a physical machine it will be the same process.
Getting a build environment ready
    1. Install general required build packages 
dnf install git rpmdevtools rpm* gcc gcc-c++ kernel-devel bison flex libtool fileutils gpg* automake make autoconf rng-tools openssl-devel lzop lzo-devel pam-devel zlib-devel cmake asciidoc xmltoman xmlto -y
    2. Install DBMail Specific build packages
dnf install gmime-devel mhash-devel libevent-devel libzdb-devel jemalloc-devel openldap-devel
    3. Create a build user since it’s highly NOT recommended to build as root user
groupadd -g 5001 pkgbuilder
useradd -u 5001 -g 5001 -c "RPM Package Builder" -s /bin/bash pkgbuilder
    4. Switch to pkgbuilder user
su – pkgbuilder
    5. Create the rpmbuild tree
rpmdev-setuptree
Getting Ready for DBMail build
DBMail has an optional dependency on the Standalone libSieve package which is  not available in Fedora repos, also DBMail has an optional dependency on LDAP which required openldap-devel package to be installed before the build process.
LibSieve is available on GitHub here https://github.com/sodabrew/libsieve, however, I built my version from SRPM (Source RPM) provided by previous OpenSUSE Or Fedora from repos archives. I have it in case it’s needed by anyone.
At this point it’s trivial to build the RPMs required for the build using the pre-made SPEC files for DBMail and Libsieve.
The Source archives should be moved to the path:
[pkgbuilder@build1 ~]$ ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES/
The SPEC File should be moved to the path:
[pkgbuilder@build1 ~]$ ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/
The command to run as the user pkgbuilder :
For Building Sieve
[pkgbuilder@build1 ~]$ rpmbuild -ba rpmbuild/SPECS/libsieve.spec → This will build libsieve and libsieve-devel (Libsieve-devel) will need to be installed on the build system BEFORE building DBMail if we need to have Sieve support.
For Building DBMail
[pkgbuilder@build1 ~]$ rpmbuild -ba rpmbuild/SPECS/dbmail.spec  # → Build DBMail RPM with LDAP, Manpages, Systemd and Sieve support.
You can edit the SPEC file and remove the features you don’t need like SYSTEMD or MANPAGES or SIEVE from the %configure section.

After the build process is complete, all built RPMs will be located in the path
[pkgbuilder@build1 ~]$ ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/<ARCH>/

Notes:
The SPEC file for DBMail is extracted from Previous Fedora SRPM but has been heavily modified to conform with the the packaging layout of the DBMail archive.
Also New Files has been included in the Archive I built from, the files added are:
    1. dbmail.cron → Crontab entry
    2. dbmail.logrotate → Logrotate config for dbmail logs
    3. dbmail.sysconfig → Some defaults by Fedora team
The SPEC File for Libsieve is extracted from previous OpenSUSE SRPM.
The Source files and SPEC Files are available.
If The project team will Validate and approve a pull request for those files as well as the SPEC files and the packaged .
