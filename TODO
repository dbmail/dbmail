For DBMail 2.0
-   remove unique_id != '' from queries, if possible without
    breaking anything.
-   check if id BETWEEN x AND x is slower than id = x (I would
    guess this is optimized away).
For DBMail 2.1
-   Configurable table prefixes
-   Sieve scripting language
-   Header caching (e.g., cache headers like To: From: etc.)
-   Put some parts of configuration into the database
-   Increase speed by doing database optimizations (e.g., indexes)
    and removing unneeded database usage.
-   Database transactions
-   Report detailed delivery conditions (e.g. over quota,
    suspended account, courtesy forwarding address) via LMTP's
    enhanced status codes and via stdout messages to the MTA
-   Handle NULLs in messages better than currently done (RFC821!).
-   Separate forwards (varchar) from deliveries (bigint)
    in the aliases table. Possibly include a mailbox, too.
-   Rather than always deleting messages after delivery, make
    it part of dbmail-util to clean out the special delivery user.
-   Import and export users and mailboxes to mbox format.
-   Combine the above two to allow for logging of all incoming messages
    (e.g. USA banks are required to archive all email by law).
-   Support for subaddress extensions of the form address+mailbox@domain,
    as this is useful for TMDA systems and Amavis-new, among others.
