DESCRIPTION
-----------
DBMail stores Sieve scripts in a table in the DBMail database. These 
scripts are used to sort incoming mail for the email users. Each user
has their own script space and may upload scripts to the
dbmail-sieved(8) daemon. The dbmail-sievecmd(8) utility provides
a convenient method for the system administrator to work with
Sieve scripts from the command line.
