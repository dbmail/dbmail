Using DBMail with Exim4
=======================

DBMail works well with Exim.

Both sql and ldap authentication are supported.

Using ldap to search for aliases using the mail attribute is supported, though
since exim 4.96 delivery addresses must be looked up. There is a sample dbmail
alias that may be helpful as a starting point for your ldap search.

Sample configuration: contrib/exim-dbmail-configure
