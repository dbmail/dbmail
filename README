What is it?
===========

DBMail is a collection of programs that enables email to be stored in and
retrieved from a database. 

Read the INSTALL file for installation of DBMail.

Why is it useful?
==================

- it enables you to create mailboxes without the need of systemusers.

- mail is more effeciently stored and therefore it can be inserted an
retrieved much faster dan any regular system (DBMail is currently able to
retrieve aprox. 250 mail messages per second)

- It's scalable. You can run the dbmail programs on different servers
talking to the same database(cluster).

- It is more secure. There's no need to maintain system users or write to
the filesystem. All this is done through the database.


Who created it?
===============

Eelco van Beek <eelco@ic-s.nl> at first created a very sloppy version of
this program which didn't work at all.

Because the DBMail mailing system is big he needed help. 
So he asked Roel <roel@ic-s.nl>, one of the people working with him 
at IC&S, to join in developing DBMail further.

In 2003 Ilja Booij joined IC&S to work on the 2.x version. During that time,
Paul Stevens at NFG also joined the development team, initially to provide 
debian packaging, later to take over development of the 2.1 release. Aaron
Stone also deserves special thanks for initiating the LDAP driver, maintaining 
the delivery chain and of course sieve support.

DBMail is now a community effort to create a fast, effecient and scalable
database driven mailingsystem. Both IC&S and NFG are fully behind 
opensource and the GPL. Therefore DBMail has the GPL licence.

Both IC&S and NFG provide commercial support and consultancy for this
product. For more information about this you can send an email to
info@ic-s.nl and/or support@nfg.nl.

It should work with almost no problem. We have clients that run dbmail
with more than 25.000 useraccounts. The system is stable.
